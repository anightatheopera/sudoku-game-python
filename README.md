# sudoku-game-python
Here's a CLI sudoku game I've made using a backtrack algorithm on python3. Additional modules used are numpy(for creating efficient arrays) and random(for generating unsolved puzzles). A future version of the same may use GUI using pygame instead, but for now this is it. Please contact me if you find any glitches in the same!
